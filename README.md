# bus-tracking-Route-planner-webapp


Connect the ESP32 to a GPS module using UART communication. The GPS module can be used to determine the location of the bus.
Write a program for the ESP32 that collects data from the GPS module and stores it in a cloud storage solution such as Firebase.
Set up a web server to host the web application. This can be done using a service such as AWS or Google Cloud, or you can host the web application on your own server.
Design the user interface for the web application. This could include a map that shows the location of the bus in real-time, as well as other information such as the bus route, estimated arrival times, and passenger capacity.
Write the code for the web application. This will involve using a web framework such as React or Angular to build the frontend of the application, and a server-side language such as Node.js or Python to build the backend.
Connect the web application to the cloud storage solution where the collected data is stored. This will involve using an API or other method to retrieve the data and display it in the user interface.
Test and deploy the web application. Make sure to test the application thoroughly before making it available to users. Once the application is ready, you can deploy it to the web server for others to access.

v1.1
The ESP32 collects data from the GPS module and stores it in a cloud storage solution such as Firebase.
The web application retrieves the GPS data from the cloud storage solution and displays the location of the bus in real-time on a map.
The web application allows users to view the bus route, estimated arrival times, and passenger capacity.
The ESP32 continuously monitors the bus for any SOS alerts.
If an SOS alert is triggered, the ESP32 sends a notification to the web application via the GPRS module.
The web application displays the SOS alert and sends notifications to the appropriate parties (e.g. emergency services, bus company).
The web application allows authorized users to acknowledge and resolve the SOS alert.
